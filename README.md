# Vaibhav Video Editor

**One command, raw clip to finished video.** Vaibhav Video Editor is a Claude Code skill that runs your video editing skills as one professional pipeline: it cuts silences and retakes, plans the edit from what you say, adds captions, motion graphics, face-tracked effects, transitions, camera moves, b-roll, sound effects and music, checks its own work, and exports the final MP4.

It doesn't replace your other video skills. It directs them: each moment in your video goes to the tool that does it best, and everything follows one plan that you approve first.

Made by Vaibhav ([@vaibhavv.ai](https://instagram.com/vaibhavv.ai)).

## What it does

| Stage | What happens |
|---|---|
| 0. Preflight | Checks which tools and skills you have and offers to install anything missing |
| 1. Brief and style | Loads your saved editing style (or a clean default) and asks only what it needs |
| 2. Prepare | Transcribes with word timings and fixes misheard names |
| 3. Clean cut | Removes silences, fillers, false starts and repeated takes |
| 4. B-roll | If you mention a website, offers to record it being used |
| 5. Storyboard | Shows the whole plan as a table (what's said, what appears, which tool, transition, sound) and waits for your OK |
| 6. Build | Renders effects, captions, cards, motion graphics and camera moves |
| 7. Sound | Sound effects on every visual beat, music ducked under your voice, mixed to -14 LUFS |
| 8. Quality check | Checks stills at every beat for faces, safe zones, spelling and timing, plus loudness |
| 9. Deliver | Final MP4, a no-music copy for trending sounds, credits, and an optional post caption |
| Voiceover mode | No footage: script → AI voice → fully animated video timed to every word |

Nothing installed yet? Vaibhav Video Editor tells you what's missing and what each piece is for, and asks before installing anything.

## Install

**Easiest:** open Claude Code and paste:

> Install the skill from https://github.com/V413havai/vaibhav-video-editor into ~/.claude/skills/vaibhav-video-editor

Claude does the rest. Then restart Claude Code.

**Or in a terminal** (Mac and Linux):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/V413havai/vaibhav-video-editor ~/.claude/skills/vaibhav-video-editor
```

On Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/V413havai/vaibhav-video-editor "$HOME\.claude\skills\vaibhav-video-editor"
```

Then restart Claude Code and type `/vaibhav-video-editor`.

**No git?** On the GitHub page click **Code → Download ZIP**, unzip it, rename the folder to `vaibhav-video-editor`, and move it into `~/.claude/skills/` so you have `~/.claude/skills/vaibhav-video-editor/SKILL.md`. (`~` is your home folder: `/Users/<you>` on a Mac, `C:\Users\<you>` on Windows. The `.claude` folder may be hidden.)

**Update to the latest version:**

```bash
git -C ~/.claude/skills/vaibhav-video-editor pull
```

**First run:** the skill checks your tools and other video skills and tells you what's missing (see the table above). It asks before installing anything.

## Use it

Drag a video into Claude Code and type:

```
/vaibhav-video-editor edit raw/my-reel.mp4 start to finish
/vaibhav-video-editor edit this with H10 C9 L4 X1 M1 S1, cinematic, music upbeat
/vaibhav-video-editor full edit, clean look, no music, end card @myhandle
/vaibhav-video-editor turn this 20 minute podcast into 3 finished shorts
```

It shows you a plan first and only renders after you say go. Then tell it changes in plain words: *"captions bigger"*, *"zoom when I say insane"*, *"the cut at 0:14 is too sudden"*.

**Animated videos with an AI voice.** No footage? Say *"make an animated video about my 5 favourite AI tools with a voiceover"*. It writes the script (you approve it), makes the voice, and animates every word in HyperFrames. Voices:

| Voice | Cost | Setup |
|---|---|---|
| ElevenLabs | paid (free plan: credit line, non-commercial) | add `export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your-key` to `~/.zshrc` |
| Google Gemini TTS | free key, free-tier limits | free key at aistudio.google.com/apikey, then `export GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key` |
| HeyGen | free with sign-in | `npx hyperframes auth login` |
| Kokoro | free, offline | one-time `pip install kokoro-onnx soundfile` (it asks first) |

Keys stay in your own environment: never paste them into the chat.

**Style presets.** Say *"edit this in Nick style"* for the look of Nick Saraev's AI-tool reels: glowing browser cards over a soft background, a numbered header, big stat callouts, 1 to 3 word captions with a blue keyword, pause-free pacing and a comment-keyword CTA. Presets live in `references/styles/`, and adding one is a single Markdown file.

**Your own style.** If you've saved a style with `/video-editor:start` or `/video-editor:style` (it lives at `~/.claude/skills/my-video-style/`), Vaibhav Video Editor follows it on every edit. Say *"add that to my style"* any time. Without one, it uses a clean, professional house style.

## Good to know

- It never modifies your original footage and never posts or uploads anything.
- It never puts graphics over your face, keeps text inside the Reels and TikTok safe zone, and never invents numbers.
- Trending songs are copyrighted: add them in the app on the no-music copy.
- Watch every video before you post it.
